          <h3>CLASS was created as a result of one couple’s passion for learning together as they were looking to make each and every date an exciting, rewarding and stress-free experience.</h3>

            <h3><i>My wife and I got tired of going on the same old dates, (i.e. dinner and a movie) and we love taking lessons and learning new things together. It is always such a challenge to find good companies or individual instructors that provide classes and even when you do, it is usually a pain to fill out all the forms, and everyone has a different method of accepting payment. We decided that if we were looking for more exciting dates, other couples must be as well. That’s how CLASS was born!
