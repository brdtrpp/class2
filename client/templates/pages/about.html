        <h1>Our Company</h1>
        <h3>CLASS was created as a result of one couple’s passion for learning together as they were looking to make each and every date an exciting, rewarding and stress-free experience.</h3>

          <h3><i>My wife and I got tired of going on the same old dates, (i.e. dinner and a movie) and we love taking lessons and learning new things together. It is always such a challenge to find good companies or individual instructors that provide classes and even when you do, it is usually a pain to fill out all the forms, and everyone has a different method of accepting payment. We decided that if we were looking for more exciting dates, other couples must be as well. That’s how CLASS was born!

      <h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
      <h3>Our philosophy is simple:</h3>
      <h3 align='center'><i><b>Learning is an adventure that should be shared.</b></i></h3>
      <h3>Our hope is that CLASS helps you find your next hobby, or encourages you to share your passion by leading your own class.</h3>
      <h3>We believe in creating communities of like-minded people – learning should be social – it’s part of the fun.</h3>
