      Our Affiliate Program
    </h1>
    <h3>
      So you're interested in becoming an affiliate of ours? Well that's just great! Our affiliate program is one of the best in the industry, 1% of every transaction associated with your affiliate ID goes to you.
    </h3>
    <h2 align='center'>Here's how it works:</h2>
    <h3>You send people to us, through a link we provide you with, then every class they pay for 1% goes to you. That sounds small, but it can add up quickly. Here's the real awesome part, if you sign up a business, freelancer or instructor that takes payments, everyone who signs up through them and is not already using the app will also be associated with you.</h3>
    <h2 align='center'>Payout Schedule</h2>
    <h3>We payout on the last day of the month, for all transactions that occured that month. Pretty simple right?</h3>
