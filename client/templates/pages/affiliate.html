      Our Affiliate Program
    </h1>
    <h4>
      So you're interested in becoming an affiliate of ours? Well that's just great! Our affiliate program is one of the best in the industry, 20% of profit from every transaction associated with your affiliate ID goes to you, forever. The more people you bring in, the more residual revenue you generate for yourself.
    </h4>
    <h2>Here's how it works:</h2>
    <h4>You send people to us, through a link we provide you with, then every class they pay for 1.8% goes to you. That sounds small, but it can add up quickly. Here's the real awesome part, if you sign up a business, freelancer or instructor that takes payments, everyone who signs up through them and is not already using the app will also be associated with you.</h4>
    <h3>Exmaple:</h3>
    <h4>An instructor, that you are affiliated with, sets a price on a class for $25/student. We mark it up by 10%, that sets the price the student pays to $27.50 (25 x 110% = 27.50) of that extra $2.50, you the affiliate gets $.50 ($2.50 * 20% = $.50) if the student isn't already using the app.</h4>
    <h2>Payout Schedule</h2>
    <h4>We payout on the first day of the month, for all transactions that occured the previous month. Pretty simple right?</h4>
