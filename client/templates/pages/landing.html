            <h3>Let's say an instructor starts a class and charges $25/student. We markup that $25 by 5% ($25 x 105% =  $26.25) and that's the advertized price of the class. When a student pays the $26.25 for the class $25 goes to the instructor the other $1.25 goes to us.</h3>
            <h3>That's it, no extra charges, no other fees, no ultra-super bonus account options available. Instructors set a class price structure, students pay for the class. Boom, it's that easy.</h3>
            <h2><strong>Payments</strong></h2>
            <h3>Students are charged at the time of registration for the class. Instructors are paid every Friday for every charge from Thursday of the pre to Wednesday of the previous week.</h3>
