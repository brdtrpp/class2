    <!-- (I’m thinking of changing this header to USING CLASS IS EASY or something that doesn’t simply say “how it works, but actually offers a concise description of “how” it works, but I haven’t nailed how I want to say it yet)-->
    <!--Also, we can turn these content sections into some sort of graphics/diagrams to make them look more fun…-->
    <!--Another option is to create a separate “How it works” page…-->
    <!--<h3>Learners</h3>-->
    <!--Create a profile, add a credit card and explore exciting classes in your area.-->
    <!--When you find something you like, just click register, confirm registration and you are ready to attend!-->
    <!--The fee for each class is securely charged to your credit card on file via Stripe.-->
    <!--<h3>Instructors</h3>-->
    <!--Name your class, set date and location, name your price and wait for registration to come in!-->
    <!--Teach your class and get paid at the end of the week.-->
    <!--CLASS does not charge you any fees to use our platform. We add a 10% markup to your fee and the total fee is what Learners see and pay.SS-->
