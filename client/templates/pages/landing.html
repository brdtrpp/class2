<h3>HOW WE ARE DIFFERENT</h3>
This section should have a graphic or pic for each blurb
We believe learning should be social. We don’t list weddings, parties or family reunions and although we offer both private and group activities, we feature more group classes than other platforms. All of our classes are in person.
We believe taking and teaching classes should be easy. We worked hard on making CLASS simple to use for both Learners and Instructors by creating a platform with Less forms, Less time, More security.
We believe exploring classes should be fun. We encourage cool and unusual classes that you may not find on other platforms.
HOW IT WORKS (I’m thinking of changing this header to USING CLASS IS EASY or something that doesn’t simply say “how it works, but actually offers a concise description of “how” it works, but I haven’t nailed how I want to say it yet)
Also, we can turn these content sections into some sort of graphics/diagrams to make them look more fun…
Another option is to create a separate “How it works” page…
<h3>Learners</h3>
Create a profile, add a credit card and explore exciting classes in your area.
When you find something you like, just click register, confirm registration and you are ready to attend!
The fee for each class is securely charged to your credit card on file via Stripe.
<h3>Instructors</h3>
Name your class, set date and location, name your price and wait for registration to come in!
Teach your class and get paid at the end of the week.
CLASS does not charge you any fees to use our platform. We add a 10% markup to your fee and the total fee is what Learners see and pay.
