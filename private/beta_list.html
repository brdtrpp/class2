    <h1>Welcome to Class (beta)!</h1>
    <h3>You have no idea how excited we are that you signed-up for our beta program!</h3>
    <p>In the following months we will show you bits and pieces of what we are working on, hopefully you will like what you see. We plan on launching the apps in June, and we are working diligently to get the best product we can into your hands.</p>
    <p>We will be sending survey's and questionaires out to make sure we aren't on the wrong track, you will help us prioritize what we work on and the information you give us will be pivotal in our success!</p>
    <h4>Once again, thank you!</h4>
